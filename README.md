# 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

So… what’s going on here?  
Well, not a startup. Not a secret lab. Just me — exploring code, breaking stuff, fixing it, and having fun along the way 😎

## 🧠 What I Know (So Far)

I’ve been playing with:

- 🐍 **Python** — for writing logic, making things happen, and sometimes confusing myself with indentation
- ⚡ **JavaScript** — for adding magic to websites and making buttons do cool things
- 🌐 **HTML** — the skeleton of the web, and yes, I’ve made a few pages that look like they were born in 2003

## 🎨 What You’ll Find Here

- Tiny projects that do tiny things  
- Code that works (most of the time)  
- Random experiments that started with “what if…”  
- Files with names like `test1.py`, `final_final_v2.html`, and `idk.js`  
- Occasional brilliance mixed with occasional chaos

## 🤹‍♀️ My Coding Style

- Write → run → error → panic → fix → celebrate 🎉  
- Google is my best friend  
- Stack Overflow is my second home  
- I talk to my code like it’s a person (and yes, sometimes it listens)

## 💻 My Mood While Coding

## 🧃 Why I’m Here

Because coding is fun.  
Because it feels like magic.  
Because I like making things that didn’t exist before.  
And because every time I learn something new, I feel like I unlocked a secret level in life.

## 🐾 Random Facts

- I’ve written code at 2am just to see if it works  
- I’ve deleted things I shouldn’t have  
- I’ve fixed bugs I didn’t understand  
- I’ve made websites that only I will ever visit  
- And I’m totally okay with that
